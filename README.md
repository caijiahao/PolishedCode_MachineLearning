Coordinate Descent Algorithm with Elastic Net Regularization
--------------------------------------------------------------

This is a polished code example of  my own implementation of a Coordinate Descent Algorithm with Elastic Net 
Regularization.  

This was done as part of my DATA 558 Machine Learning course at the University of Washington.

For examples of implementation, please see 
the [examples](https://github.com/samirpdx/PolishedCode_MachineLearning/tree/master/examples) folder.  
No data files are required for download, as they are downloaded into the notebook via URLs.

For viewing the raw Python code for this implementation, please refer 
to [myelasticnet.py](https://github.com/samirpdx/PolishedCode_MachineLearning/blob/master/src/myelasticnet.py)

Installation
---------------

_Note:  To run this package you will need familiarity with bash command line and Jupyter Notebook._

In a directory on your local machine, run the following `git` command in the bash terminal to clone the 
`PolishedCode_MachineLearning` repository onto your computer:

```
git clone https://github.com/samirpdx/PolishedCode_MachineLearning.git
```

Then in the bash terminal go to the `src` folder in the newly installed package folder:

```
cd PolishedCode_MachineLearning/src/
```

And install the package by running the `setup.py` file:

```
python setup.py install
```
