Coordinate Descent Algorithm with Elastic Net Regularization
--------------------------------------------------------------

This is a polished code example of a my own implementation of an Elastic Net Regularized, Coordinate Descent Algorithm.  This was done as part of my DATA 558 Machine Learning course at the University of Washington.
