Examples
=============================

In this directory, examples of the Coordinate Descent Algorithm with Elastic Net Regularization can be found 
in the following IPython Notebooks:

- Polished Code - ElasticNet (Comparison with Sci-Kit Learn).ipynb
- Polished Code - ElasticNet (Real-World Example).ipynb
- Polished Code - ElasticNet (Simulated Example).ipynb

These examples will import the module `myelasticnet` which contains my own implementation of the Coordinate Descent
Algorithms (both cyclic and random types).
